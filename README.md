# Relaydesk

Open-source AI-native customer support.

Relaydesk is building an open platform for modern customer support, with a
self-hostable codebase and a managed cloud offering. The project is currently
in its initial development stage.

## Project status

Relaydesk is under active early development. The current repository provides a
minimal Next.js, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL foundation; product functionality has
not been implemented yet.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Start

```sh
git clone <repository-url> relaydesk
cd relaydesk
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Then visit:

- Web: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Development commands

```sh
make dev   # Build and start the development stack
make down  # Stop the stack
make logs  # Follow service logs
make clean # Stop the stack and remove its development volumes
```

API source and web source are bind-mounted into their development containers, so
changes are picked up without rebuilding the images.

## Testing and linting

With the development stack running:

```sh
docker compose exec api pytest
docker compose exec api ruff check .
docker compose exec web pnpm lint
docker compose exec web pnpm build
```
